# Tesla Inventory Checker

This is an AWS hosted lambda function to check whether there is new existing inventory for Tesla near my home area.

Simply cloning this repo will not be sufficient to make this work as there are AWS configurations to make such as: 

- Credentials
- SES setup
- Lambda Trigger setup
- DynamoDB setup

This is just a fun project done in < 12 hours to stop checking the existing inventory page while I patiently wait for a VIN to be assigned. :)
